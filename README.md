# OpusTimization
Our website lets users enter their travel periods and the number of rides into a calendar. It then generates the optimal combinations of passes to buy for the next 31 days.

# Inspiration
As students, we use Opus cards every day. During December, the month of exams, buying a combination of passes is sometimes cheaper than a monthly pass.

# How we built it
We coded in Python and used the Tkinter (python interface), VS code, and Thonny.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few challenges. Firstly, we had trouble deciding if our product would be an app, a website, an extension, or a widget. Since we have no experience with interfaces, we did not know where to start with this aspect. Moreover, generating algorithms for 24-hour, 3-day, consecutive, and weekly passes was extremely hard. After a few tries, we have focused on only 1, 2, 10, and monthly passes. Lastly, we had trouble merging our code altogether.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our teamwork and cumulative effort in achieving this project. As beginners, we did our best to reach our goals and have fun. With a lot of hours of discussions and coding, we were able to make a good product.

# What we learned
We learned to listen to each other and synthesize our ideas together. We also learned the Tkinter calendar and an introduction to interfaces. We have practiced our Python skills and developed our organizational skills.

# What's next for OpusTimization
We want to work on making the interface more appealing and integrating it into a website that might be useful for apps like Chrono or Transit.
